Spotify-Apple-Scripts
=====================

Some Apple Scripts to make Spotify play easier

I created these and linked them to Alfred's global hot keys.  That way I have basically created hotkeys to do tasks such as go to the next track, previous track, pause/play etc.

About the spotifyplaylist.scpt

I created this to quickly be able to play one my most listened to playlists. It's pretty useful if you are like me and only listen to a few playlists.

Enjoy :)
